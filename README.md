🔭 Currently working on an AI-powered Telegram bot with image generation capabilities, focusing on Java-based backend architecture, cloud integrations, and distributed system design.

In parallel, transitioning toward systems programming with Rust, building high-performance, memory-safe components and security-critical prototypes aligned with modern confidential computing paradigms.

🌱 Actively deepening expertise in backend engineering (concurrency, distributed systems, performance optimization) and major cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP).

Expanding into Rust and low-level architecture to prepare for work in confidential computing, trusted execution environments (TEE), cryptographic attestation flows, and secure cloud-native infrastructure.
