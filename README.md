🔭 Currently working on an AI-powered Telegram bot with image generation capabilities, primarily focused on Java-based backend architecture, cloud integrations, and system design.
In parallel, experimenting with Go for selected microservices and interview-oriented, high-performance prototypes.

🌱 Actively deepening expertise in Java (backend development, concurrency, distributed system design) and major cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP).
At the same time, learning Go to broaden the backend skill set and prepare for building cloud-native, scalable, and high-performance services.
